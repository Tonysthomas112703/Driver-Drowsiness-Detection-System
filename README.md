# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System
<p>Abstract of the Project...<p>

<p>Driver drowsiness is a significant cause of road accidents, posing a threat 
to both the driver and other road users. In this mini project, we propose a 
driver drowsiness detection system utilizing OpenCV (Open Source 
Computer Vision Library) and EAR (Eye Aspect Ratio) algorithm. The 
objective is to accurately identify signs of drowsiness based on the driver’s 
eye behaviour and provide timely alerts to prevent potential accidents. The 
system employs computer vision techniques to track and analyse the 
driver’s eyes in real-time. By calculating the EAR, which quantifies the 
eye’s openness, we can detect when the driver’s eyes start to exhibit signs 
of fatigue or drowsiness. When the EAR value falls below a predefined 
threshold, indicating closed or partially closed eyes, an alarm or notification 
is triggered to alert the driver and prompt them to regain their focus on the 
road. To implement the system, we utilize OpenCV, a widely-used opensource computer vision library, which provides a comprehensive set of 
functions for image and video analysis. By leveraging the library’s 
capabilities, we can perform eye tracking, feature extraction, and EAR 
calculation efficiently. The system can process video input from a webcam 
or any suitable camera source, making it adaptable to various driving 
scenarios. Through this mini project, we aim to demonstrate the 
effectiveness of using computer vision techniques, specifically OpenCV 
and the EAR algorithm, in detecting driver drowsiness. The system’s real-
4
time monitoring capability combined with timely alerts can contribute to 
enhancing road safety by mitigating the risks associated with drowsy 
driving. The experiment results and evaluation offer insights into the 
performance of the proposed driver drowsiness detection system.<p>
